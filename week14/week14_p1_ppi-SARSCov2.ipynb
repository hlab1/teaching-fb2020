epigenetic memory across cell divisions and transcription regulation. Remains associated with acetylated chromatin throughout the entire cell cycle and provides epigenetic memory for postmitotic G1 gene transcription by preserving acetylated chromatin status and maintaining high-order chromatin structure (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:23317504, PubMed:22334664). During interphase, plays a key role in regulating the transcription of signal-inducible genes by associating with the P-TEFb complex and recruiting it to promoters. Also recruits P-TEFb complex to distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers in collaboration with JMJD6. BRD4 and JMJD6 are required to form the transcriptionally active P-TEFb complex by displacing negative regulators such as HEXIM1 and 7SKsnRNA complex from P-TEFb, thereby transforming it into an active form that can then phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:19596240, PubMed:16109377, PubMed:16109376, PubMed:24360279). Promotes phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23086925). According to a report, directly acts as an atypical protein kinase and mediates phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; these data however need additional evidences in vivo (PubMed:22509028). In addition to acetylated histones, also recognizes and binds acetylated RELA, leading to further recruitment of the P-TEFb complex and subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19103749). Also acts as a regulator of p53/TP53-mediated transcription: following phosphorylation by CK2, recruited to p53/TP53 specific target promoters (PubMed:23317504). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19103749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19596240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22334664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22509028, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23086925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23317504, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23589332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24360279}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform B]: Acts as a chromatin insulator in the DNA damage response pathway.

transmission of epigenetic memory across cell divisions and transcription regulation. Remains associated with acetylated chromatin throughout the entire cell cycle and provides epigenetic memory for postmitotic G1 gene transcription by preserving acetylated chromatin status and maintaining high-order chromatin structure (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:23317504, PubMed:22334664). During interphase, plays a key role in regulating the transcription of signal-inducible genes by associating with the P-TEFb complex and recruiting it to promoters. Also recruits P-TEFb complex to distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers in collaboration with JMJD6. BRD4 and JMJD6 are required to form the transcriptionally active P-TEFb complex by displacing negative regulators such as HEXIM1 and 7SKsnRNA complex from P-TEFb, thereby transforming it into an active form that can then phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:19596240, PubMed:16109377, PubMed:16109376, PubMed:24360279). Promotes phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23086925). According to a report, directly acts as an atypical protein kinase and mediates phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; these data however need additional evidences in vivo (PubMed:22509028). In addition to acetylated histones, also recognizes and binds acetylated RELA, leading to further recruitment of the P-TEFb complex and subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19103749). Also acts as a regulator of p53/TP53-mediated transcription: following phosphorylation by CK2, recruited to p53/TP53 specific target promoters (PubMed:23317504). \\{ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:16109376, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:16109377, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:19103749, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:19596240, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:22334664, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:22509028, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:23086925, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:23317504, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:23589332, ECO:0000269\\textbar{}PubMed:24360279\\}.; FUNCTION: {[}Isoform B{]}: Acts as a chromatin insulator in the DNA damage response pathway.

      | \" Subunit of non-clathrin- and clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes. The AP complexes mediate both the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-3 appears to be involved in the sorting of a subset of transmembrane proteins targeted to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | \" Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome 2 (HPS2) [MIM:608233]: A form of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, a genetically heterogeneous autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding due to platelet storage pool deficiency, and lysosomal storage defects.

| \" Chromatin reader protein that recognizes and binds acetylated histones and plays a key role in transmission of epigenetic memory across cell divisions and transcription regulation. Remains associated with acetylated chromatin throughout the entire cell cycle and provides epigenetic memory for postmitotic G1 gene transcription by preserving acetylated chromatin status and maintaining high-order chromatin structure (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:23317504, PubMed:22334664). During interphase, plays a key role in regulating the transcription of signal-inducible genes by associating with the P-TEFb complex and recruiting it to promoters. Also recruits P-TEFb complex to distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers in collaboration with JMJD6. BRD4 and JMJD6 are required to form the transcriptionally active P-TEFb complex by displacing negative regulators such as HEXIM1 and 7SKsnRNA complex from P-TEFb, thereby transforming it into an active form that can then phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:19596240, PubMed:16109377, PubMed:16109376, PubMed:24360279). Promotes phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23086925). According to a report, directly acts as an atypical protein kinase and mediates phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; these data however need additional evidences in vivo (PubMed:22509028). In addition to acetylated histones, also recognizes and binds acetylated RELA, leading to further recruitment of the P-TEFb complex and subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19103749). Also acts as a regulator of p53/TP53-mediated transcription: following phosphorylation by CK2, recruited to p53/TP53 specific target promoters (PubMed:23317504). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19103749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19596240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22334664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22509028, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23086925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23317504, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23589332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24360279}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform B]: Acts as a chromatin insulator in the DNA damage response pathway.

       "1 \" Subunit of non-clathrin- and clathrin-associated adaptor protein complex 3 (AP-3) that plays a role in protein sorting in the late-Golgi/trans-Golgi network (TGN) and/or endosomes. The AP complexes mediate both the recruitment of clathrin to membranes and the recognition of sorting signals within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-3 appears to be involved in the sorting of a subset of transmembrane proteins targeted to lysosomes and lysosome-related organelles. In concert with the BLOC-1 complex, AP-3 is required to target cargos into vesicles assembled at cell bodies for delivery into neurites and nerve terminals.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "2 \" Chromatin reader protein that recognizes and binds acetylated histones and plays a key role in transmission of epigenetic memory across cell divisions and transcription regulation. Remains associated with acetylated chromatin throughout the entire cell cycle and provides epigenetic memory for postmitotic G1 gene transcription by preserving acetylated chromatin status and maintaining high-order chromatin structure (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:23317504, PubMed:22334664). During interphase, plays a key role in regulating the transcription of signal-inducible genes by associating with the P-TEFb complex and recruiting it to promoters. Also recruits P-TEFb complex to distal enhancers, so called anti-pause enhancers in collaboration with JMJD6. BRD4 and JMJD6 are required to form the transcriptionally active P-TEFb complex by displacing negative regulators such as HEXIM1 and 7SKsnRNA complex from P-TEFb, thereby transforming it into an active form that can then phosphorylate the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23589332, PubMed:19596240, PubMed:16109377, PubMed:16109376, PubMed:24360279). Promotes phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (PubMed:23086925). According to a report, directly acts as an atypical protein kinase and mediates phosphorylation of 'Ser-2' of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II; these data however need additional evidences in vivo (PubMed:22509028). In addition to acetylated histones, also recognizes and binds acetylated RELA, leading to further recruitment of the P-TEFb complex and subsequent activation of NF-kappa-B (PubMed:19103749). Also acts as a regulator of p53/TP53-mediated transcription: following phosphorylation by CK2, recruited to p53/TP53 specific target promoters (PubMed:23317504). {ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109376, ECO:0000269|PubMed:16109377, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19103749, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19596240, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22334664, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22509028, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23086925, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23317504, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23589332, ECO:0000269|PubMed:24360279}.; FUNCTION: [Isoform B]: Acts as a chromatin insulator in the DNA damage response pathway. Inhibits DNA damage response signaling by recruiting the condensin-2 complex to acetylated histones, leading to chromatin structure remodeling, insulating the region from DNA damage response by limiting spreading of histone H2AX/H2A.x phosphorylation. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23728299}.\"\n",

This syndrome results from defects of diverse cytoplasmic organelles including melanosomes, platelet dense granules and lysosomes. Ceroid storage in the lungs is associated with pulmonary fibrosis, a common cause of premature death in individuals with HPS. HPS2 differs from the other forms of HPS in that it includes immunodeficiency in its phenotype and patients with HPS2 have an increased susceptibility to infections. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10024875}.
